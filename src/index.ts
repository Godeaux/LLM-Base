// ⛔ DO NOT REPLACE THIS FILE UNTIL .llm/DISCOVERY.md IS COMPLETED.
//
// This file is rewritten during the bootstrap process (see .llm/BOOTSTRAP.md).
// The pre-commit hook will reject commits if DISCOVERY.md still has template placeholders.
//
// To begin:
//   1. Open this project in your AI coding editor
//   2. Say: "I want to build [your game idea]. Let's get started."
//   3. Answer the discovery questions (vision → gameplay → technical)
//   4. The AI fills in DISCOVERY.md and DECISIONS.md, then rewrites this file
