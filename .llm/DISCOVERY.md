# Project Discovery

> This document starts as a questionnaire. After the bootstrap conversation, the LLM rewrites it into a filled-in design document for your specific game. If the fields below are still blank, the bootstrap hasn't happened yet — start by describing your game idea.

## Incremental Build Plan

After first playable, grow iteratively:

1. Play it
2. Identify what feels worst
3. Fix or add ONE thing
4. Repeat

**Quality checks every increment:**
- Build passes with no errors
- Lint passes with no warnings
- Tests pass
- See `TOOLING.md` for engine-specific commands
- Add tests for new systems as you go
